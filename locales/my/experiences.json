  "title1": "Begin of My Journey",
  "description1": "After graduated from my university, I found my first job as a programmer in May 2017. I worked in a startup software house company; Newgate Software Sdn. Bhd. I was assigned to work on an e-commerce project that will be launch in China. We used the Java spring boot framework to implement the backend API system and Angular2 for the Admin portal. I was a bit frustrated at that time because the whole company is structureless. Everyone just randomly doing their things without communicate with each other. Even though I didn't regret joining this company but It was definitely a bad decision by me.",
  "title2": "Understanding Networking",
  "description2": "At the end of May, I decided to left my company because of the management issue in that company. I found an in-house software company for my next job. It's a DataCenter Infrastructure Management System company; Ekova System Sdn. Bhd. In this company, I was in charge to enhance the existing system as well as implement a new feature to it. Besides, I also developed a mobile application for the system by using existing API using the IONIC framework. A friendly colleague of mine taught me a lot about network knowledge (public IP, local IP, VPN, domain, etc.) and I start to create my portfolio website and host it myself in a rented VPS.",
  "title3": "Technical just isn't enough",
  "description3": "At the beginning of June 2019, I again decided to leave my company because I thought that I haven't had the experience to work in a big company. I want to know how big a company runs its operation to deliver the product effectively. I joined Binary Sdn. Bhd.; A trading platform company and I started to work with a group of talented people. I learned a lot of technical knowledge that I haven't got a chance to discover in my previous job. For example: `lerna monorepo`, `Blockly`, `Git`, `svg image/icon`. However, there's also the downside of joining a big company. A meeting in a day is minimal; Sometimes, there will be 3 or 4 meetings per day. Sitting down coding for a day is nearly impossible. Other than that, I realize working in a big company hardworking just isn't enough. You need to learn how to present your work to your HOD and most importantly present yourself.",
  "title4": "Work-life Balance",
  "description4": "In this year, I have been switching a few company because I was looking for a good culture company that provide work-life balance and good benefits. This isn't mean that I was laying off and just doing programming for the sake of money. I want to work on things I love and worry less about my financial condition.",
  "title5": "Journey Continue",
  "description5": "I'm happy that I'm a Software Developer right now. Even though working as a Software Developer needs to be extremely hardworking to keep up-to-date with the trend but anyhow I'm passionate about programming and can't wait to explore further about it."
